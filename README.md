This code allows you to find the best path from one side of a map to the other, where the map is represented as a 2D array containing elevation data.

Their are two implementations to solve this problem, BestGreedyPath which finds its path by choosing the easiest option at any given junction, this leads to it not always providing the optimal path. Whereas BestPath will provide the path with the smallest elevation change over the path, ie. the optimal path.
